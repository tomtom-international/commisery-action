name: 'Bump version'
author: 'Joost Muller'
description: >
  Examines Conventional Commits since the latest SemVer-compatible tag, and bumps the major-,
  minor- or patch-level accordingly; breaking changes bump major, `feat` bumps minor and `fix` bumps patch.
  Note that the action will find the topographically nearest tag that ends in a SemVer and will use that
  for the rest of the logic. Optionally, a `version-prefix` can be provided to specify which tags to consider.

  This action can optionally create a new GitHub release when a version bump is performed, but only
  if it isn't called from a `pull_request` event.
